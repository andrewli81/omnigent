"""Drift guard: every agent — top-level ``examples/*.yaml``,
dir-shaped ``examples/<name>/`` (containing ``config.yaml``), or
test-only ``tests/resources/agents/<name>/`` — must have a
dedicated ``test_example_<name>.py`` file under
``tests/e2e/omnigent/``.

When a new agent lands in any of those roots, the author should
add a test file in the same commit. This test fails loud if an
agent ships without one, and loud again if a test file points
at an agent that no longer exists.

Not a functional test — just a structural cross-check so the
coverage-per-agent rule can't silently drift.
